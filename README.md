# Distributor - CRM - abandoned

Distributor is a personal project developed with the aim of providing a simple yet effective CRM solution for managing a list of active product distributors. Utilizing Flask for the backend and Svelte for the frontend, this application offers a lightweight, responsive interface for users to interact with their data efficiently. The project was conceived to address specific needs within a company for identifying distributors, maintaining up-to-date contact information, and facilitating easy communication through email.

At the heart of Distributor is its core functionality: database management for importing and backing up distributor data, ensuring that user data remains secure and accessible. Integration with Nextcloud via API adds an additional layer of functionality, allowing users to store and manage documents related to distributors directly within the application. This feature is particularly useful for companies looking to streamline their document management processes and enhance collaboration among team members.
